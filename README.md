# **2021 Project Blind Eye**
## **Members:** Tremaine Tan, Ashley Khng

**Objective of Project:** To create a tool which can aid blind people in reading contents on paper out loud, be it text or images.

**Project Overview**

* Scanner: A design that contains a Raspberry Pi, a Camera, and Speaker to read contents and speak it out
* Another 3D Printed Stand that allows Raspberry Pi to be mounted on to read paper that is placed in the stand flat

**Devices Needed**

1. Raspberry Pi
2. Raspberry Pi Camera
3. Miniature Speaker to be connected to the Raspberry Pi
4. A Button For Taking Picture

**Project Use**

1. All the code in the Project_Folder will not work without the YOLO Library as the library is too large to be committed to github.
2. Furthermore, the code will only work with the hardware that we created, so essentially the code is just for viewing in relation to object detection
3. Ignore the folder Other_Resources as it was used for testing components
